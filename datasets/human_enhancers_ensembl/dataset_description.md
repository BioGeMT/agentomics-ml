The Human enhancers Ensembl dataset aggregates enhancer elements from the FANTOM5 atlas via the Ensembl Regulatory Build. Positive sequences cover enhancers active across diverse human cell and tissue types profiled with Cap Analysis of Gene Expression, and negatives are random GRCh38 loci length-matched to the enhancers and filtered to remove regulatory annotations. CSV files expose sequence and target columns, where target is positive or negative. The benchmark is class-balanced with 77,421 sequences per label across training and test splits, and typical sequence spans are a few hundred base pairs.

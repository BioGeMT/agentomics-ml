The siRBench siRNA–mRNA Interaction Dataset contains 4,098 labeled samples (3,408 training and 690 testing) that pair siRNAs with their target mRNAs, extended flanking regions, and an experimentally measured efficacy score, which represents how effectively each siRNA represses its target mRNA. Each record also includes a binary label (efficient vs. inefficient), source dataset, and cell line metadata. Beyond the raw sequences and biological metadata (source dataset, cell line), each entry is enriched with 25 structural and thermodynamic descriptors capturing the energetics of siRNA–mRNA binding. These include positional free energies (ΔG) at key sites (positions 1, 2, 13, 18, and overall duplex), enthalpy terms (ΔH at position 1 and global ΔH), single-nucleotide indicators (U₁, U₂, G₁, C₁, A₁₉), and dinucleotide/sequence-context features such as UU₁, GG₁, GC₁, CG₁, CC₁, along with their global counterparts (U_all, G_all, C_all, UU_all, GG_all, GC_all, CC_all, UA_all). These 24 features quantify both local sequence preferences and overall duplex stability. A 25th feature, duplex_folding_dG, was added using RNAfold, providing a global free-energy measure of siRNA secondary structure stability.

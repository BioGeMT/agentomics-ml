The siRBench dataset contains 19-nt guide (`siRNA`, upper-case with `T` converted to `U` and truncated to 19 bases), its complementary 19-nt target segment (`mRNA`), and the extended target context (`extended_mRNA`, padded with `X` for missing flanks). The continuous label of knockdown efficacy (`target`), plus a curated set of numeric features:

Thermodynamic composition features are computed from nearest-neighbour tables. `ends` captures the 5′–3′ ΔG difference with end-type bonuses, while `DG_total` and `DH_total` report the cumulative ΔG and ΔH for the guide strand after summing initiation, terminal, symmetry, and all stacked-pair contributions. Per-position stacks are exposed via `DG_pos1` … `DG_pos18` and `DH_pos1` … `DH_pos18`, representing the ΔG/ΔH constants for each of the 18 dinucleotide steps along the guide.

Single-strand folding behaviour is estimated with RNAfold. `single_energy_total` is the minimum free energy (MFE) of the isolated siRNA, and `single_energy_pos1` … `single_energy_pos19` measure the penalty (`E_constrained − E_baseline`) when each base is forced unpaired; larger positive values indicate that the base stabilises the native fold.

Duplex formation is characterised with RNAcofold. `duplex_energy_total` records the cofold MFE for the siRNA–mRNA pair. Position-wise penalties are stored in `duplex_energy_sirna_pos1` … `duplex_energy_sirna_pos19` for the guide strand and `duplex_energy_target_pos1` … `duplex_energy_target_pos19` for the target strand, each reflecting the energetic cost of forcing the respective nucleotide unpaired within the duplex.

Accessibility metrics are produced with RNAup: `RNAup_open_dG` is the combined opening energy needed to expose both binding sites, and `RNAup_interaction_dG` captures the hybridisation energy between the accessible regions. All energies are reported in kcal/mol (more negative values imply greater stabilisation). Every numeric feature is rounded to three decimal places. The nearest-neighbour descriptors depend solely on the guide sequence, whereas the folding and accessibility values are specific to the siRNA–target pairing.

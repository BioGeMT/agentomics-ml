The siRBench siRNA–mRNA Interaction Dataset contains 4,098 labeled samples (3,408 training and 690 testing), each pairing a 19-nt siRNA guide sequence (“siRNA”) with its complementary mRNA target site (“mRNA”) and a broader extended_mRNA context including surrounding flanking bases. Each record provides a continuous efficacy label (“target”) measuring knockdown strength, a derived binary class (“binary”) distinguishing efficient vs. inefficient cases, and supporting metadata for the dataset source (“source”) and experimental cell line (“cell_line”). In addition to sequences and labels, siRBench includes an extensive panel of thermodynamic and structural descriptors: global duplex stability (DG_sum_f1), local dinucleotide free energies across positions 1–18 (DG_pos1–DG_pos18) with a 5′–3′ stability offset (ends), and enthalpy terms at both the first dinucleotide (DH_1) and overall (DH_all). Sequence-level indicators capture key nucleotides at functional positions (U_1, U_2, G_1, C_1, A_19), while dinucleotide motifs (UU_1, GG_1, GC_1, CC_1, CG_1) and global composition fractions (U_all, G_all, UU_all, GG_all, GC_all, CC_all, UA_all) encode broader sequence preferences. To capture cross-molecule interactions, siRBench integrates RNAcofold duplex energies (“duplex_cofold_dG”) and RNAup-derived accessibility metrics—opening (RNAup_open_dG), interaction (RNAup_interaction_dG), and total energies (RNAup_total_dG)—providing a rich, multi-scale representation of siRNA–mRNA binding strength, target accessibility, and duplex stability.

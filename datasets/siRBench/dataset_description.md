The siRBench dataset contains “siRNA” (19‑nt guide; standardized T→U and truncated to 19), “mRNA” (19‑nt complementary target), “extended_mRNA” (target site with flanking context), and a continuous knockdown label "target", plus a curated set of numeric features: “ends” (5′→3′ end ΔG difference with end‑type adjustment, kcal/mol) and “DH_all” (total nearest‑neighbor enthalpy over 18 dinucleotides with initiation and AU‑end bonuses, kcal/mol); global base fractions “U_all” and “G_all” (counts/19), and dinucleotide fractions “UU_all”, “GG_all”, “GC_all”, “CC_all”, “UA_all” computed over the 18 sliding 2‑nt windows (counts/18); single‑strand folding features from RNAfold consisting of “single_energy_total” (minimum free energy, kcal/mol) and position‑wise effects “single_energy_pos1” … “single_energy_pos19”, where each value is the change in stability when that base is forced unpaired; duplex features from RNAcofold consisting of “duplex_energy_total” (cofold MFE, kcal/mol) and per‑base pairing effects on both strands, “duplex_energy_sirna_pos1” … “duplex_energy_sirna_pos19” and “duplex_energy_target_pos1” … “duplex_energy_target_pos19”, defined analogously by forcing the indicated base unpaired during cofold; and RNAup accessibility/hybridization terms “RNAup_open_dG” (sum of siRNA and target opening energies, kcal/mol) and “RNAup_interaction_dG” (hybridization energy, kcal/mol). All energies are reported in kcal/mol (more negative indicates greater thermodynamic stability), composition fractions are proportions in [0,1], and all numeric columns are rounded to two decimals.

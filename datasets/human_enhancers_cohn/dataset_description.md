The Human enhancers Cohn dataset follows the benchmark created by Cohn et al. (2018) for enhancer identification. Positive samples are 500 bp human enhancer loci supplied by the authors and remapped to the GRCh38 reference genome, while negatives are length-matched genomic segments without enhancer annotations. Each CSV row holds sequence and target columns, where target is positive or negative. The dataset remains nearly balanced with 13,895 positives and 13,896 negatives across train and test splits, providing a curated binary task for evaluating enhancer detection models on human DNA.

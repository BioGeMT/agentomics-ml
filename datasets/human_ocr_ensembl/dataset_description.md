The Human open chromatin Ensembl dataset collects open chromatin regions from the Ensembl Regulatory Build (release 100). Positive sequences correspond to DNase-seq accessible regions lacking more specific annotations such as promoters or enhancers; negatives are random GRCh38 segments matched in length and filtered to avoid regulatory overlaps. CSV files contain sequence and target columns, with target equal to positive or negative. The dataset is balanced with 87,378 sequences per class across training and test partitions, highlighting chromatin accessibility in few-hundred-base-pair windows.

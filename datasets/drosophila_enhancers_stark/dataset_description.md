The Drosophila enhancers Stark dataset contrasts experimentally validated enhancer regions from Stark Lab with synthetic background loci sampled from the Drosophila melanogaster dm6 genome. Positive sequences were originally reported on the dm3 assembly and lifted over to dm6, with weak enhancer calls removed during curation. Negative sequences are random dm6 fragments matched in length to the positives and filtered to avoid overlap. The CSV files contain columns sequence and target, with target equal to positive or negative. Across train and test splits there are 3,457 samples per class, and sequences span roughly two kilobases on average.

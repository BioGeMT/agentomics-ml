The AGO2 Hejret2023 dataset was adapted from miRBench, which catalogues microRNA binding sites measured with CLASH (crosslinking, ligation, and sequencing of hybrids). Each example pairs a 50 nt gene fragment containing the candidate binding site with a 17–26 nt microRNA sequence. Positive labels correspond to miRNA–mRNA hybrids observed in CLASH, whereas negatives reuse the microRNA but couple it with a randomly selected gene fragment. The CSV files store columns gene, noncodingRNA, noncodingRNA_name, noncodingRNA_fam, feature, target, chr, start, end, strand, and gene_cluster_ID, where target is 1 for true interactions and 0 otherwise. The combined train and test partitions contain 4,579 positives and 4,579 negatives, yielding a balanced benchmark for microRNA target recognition.

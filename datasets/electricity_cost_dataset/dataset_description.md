This dataset is taken from [Kaggle: Electricity Cost Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shalmamuji/electricity-cost-prediction-dataset).

This dataset, titled "Powering Predictions: Unveiling the Dynamics of Electricity Costs in Modern Infrastructure," provides a realistic and comprehensive collection of 10,000 data points designed for electricity cost prediction. It encompasses a variety of factors influencing energy consumption and expenditure across different types of sites. The dataset includes the following key columns:
Site Area (square meters): Represents the physical size of the property, a primary driver of energy needs.
Structure Type: Categorizes the property into 'Residential', 'Commercial', 'Mixed-use', or 'Industrial', reflecting diverse operational and consumption patterns.
Water Consumption (liters/day): An indirect indicator of energy use, particularly for water heating and pumping.
Recycling Rate (%): Suggests the environmental consciousness and potential energy efficiency practices of the site.
Utilisation Rate (%): Indicates the operational intensity and capacity usage, directly impacting energy demand.
Air Quality Index (AQI): Can influence energy consumption through HVAC system usage for maintaining indoor air quality.
Issue Resolution Time (hours): A proxy for operational efficiency; longer resolution times may correlate with energy waste.
Resident Count (number of people): A significant factor for residential and mixed-use properties, directly affecting electricity usage.
Electricity Cost (USD/month): The target variable, representing the monthly electricity expenditure, influenced by all other parameters.

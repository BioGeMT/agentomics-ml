The Human enhancers Cohn dataset was adapted from [BioRxiv. 2018:264200]. Enhancers are genomic regulatory functional elements that can be bound by specific DNA binding proteins so as to regulate the transcription of a particular gene. Unlike promoters, enhancers do not need to be in a close proximity to the affected gene, and may be up to several million bases away, making their detection a difficult task.

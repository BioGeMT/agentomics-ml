# Follow the biomlbench docs (relevant parts copypasted below)
This can be done outside of our repository completely

## Install with uv
Note: Currently running on python <= 3.12 is recommended due to uv package issues
```
git clone https://github.com/science-machine/biomlbench.git
cd biomlbench
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## Pull prebuilt images (recommended - saves build time)
`./scripts/pull_prebuilt_images.sh`

## Prepare a task
Create a polaris API key and run
`polaris login --overwrite`

Then prepare a dataset

`biomlbench prepare -t polarishub/tdcommons-caco2-wang`

# Run agentomics as a biomlbench agent
## Copy the agent configs
Take the `agentomics-ml` folder (sibling to this readme) and place it inside the `biomlbench/agents` folder

Paste a valid `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` inside the `biomlbench/agents/agentomics-ml/config.yaml` config

Setup run parameters in `biomlbench/agents/agentomics-ml/start.sh`

## Build the agent
`./scripts/build_agent.sh agentomics-ml`

## Run the agent on the prepared task
`biomlbench run-agent --agent agentomics-ml --task-id polarishub/tdcommons-caco2-wang`

If you run into Errors, explore the run error log. If there is an issue with not having enough CPU cores, try changing `biomlbench/environment/config/container_configs/default.json` parameter `nano_cpus` from 12000000000 to for example 8000000000 (for 8 cores)

## Evaluate the agent output
`biomlbench grade-sample runs/<biomlbench_run_id>/polarishub/<biomlbench_dataset_id>/submission/submission.csv polarishub/tdcommons-caco2-wang`

the run id and dataset id will be generated by biomlbench and can be found in `biomlbench/runs`

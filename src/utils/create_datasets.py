        The AGO2 Hejret2023 dataset was adapted from [miRBench: novel benchmark datasets for microRNA binding site prediction that mitigate against prevalent microRNA Frequency Class Bias]. 
        This dataset contains microRNA sequences and their corresponding binding sites, as 
        identified via a CLASH (crosslinking, ligation, and sequencing of hybrids) experiment. 
        There are two sequences in this dataset: gene and noncodingRNA. 
        The gene sequences are 50nt fragments including a target site of the noncodingRNA. 
        We expect that the targeting occurs via partial complementarity of the two sequences.
        Samples with label==1 are target sites retrieved from the CLASH experiment. 
        For each of these positive samples, a negative sample (label==0) is created by matching the same 
        noncodingRNA sequence with a randomly selected gene sequence.

Enhancers are genomic regulatory functional elements that can be bound by specific DNA binding proteins so as to regulate the transcription of a particular gene. Unlike promoters, enhancers do not need to be in a close proximity to the affected gene, and may be up to several million bases away, making their detection a difficult task.",

These enhancers were experimentally validated and we excluded the weak ones. Original coordinates referred to the dm3 [2007;316(5831):1625–8] assembly of the D. melanogaster genome. We used pyliftoverFootnote 3 tool to map coordinates to the dm6 assembly [Nucleic Acids Res. 2015;43(D1):690–7].

Open chromatin regions are regions of the genome that can be preferentially accessed by DNA regulatory elements because of their open chromatin structure. In the Ensembl Regulatory Build, this label is assigned to open chromatin regions, which were experimentally observed through DNase-seq, but covered by none of the other annotations (enhancer, promoter, gene, TSS, CTCF, etc.). Negative sequences were generated from the Human genome GRCh38 to match the lengths of positive sequences and not overlap them.",

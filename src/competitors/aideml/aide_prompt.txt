 Create the best possible classifier model and inference script that is able to load the trained model and do inference on new data. 
 
 ATTENTION!: For you final solution, you MUST make the script to be able to take argparse arguments --input (for new unseen data csv) and --output (for predictions file). 
        
        You are using a linux system.
        You have access to both CPU and GPU.
        You run in a conda environment and you are allowed to install any dependencies you need.

        DATASET:
        - Training file: input/train.csv

        Dataset knowledge: input/dataset_description.md

        REQUIREMENTS:
        - 1 trained model file.
        - 1 script that is able to load the trained model and do inference on new data that is be able to take argparse arguments --input (for new unseen data csv) and --output (for predictions file).
